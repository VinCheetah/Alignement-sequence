# Alignement-sequence

This project was made during my second year of "Classe Pr√©paratoire aux Grandes Ecoles" Mathematics-Physics.

The main theme was "Health, prevention", and during the covid crisis i choose to study DNA mutations of Covid-19.
To do so i have implemented in Python and Ocaml some sequences-alignment algorithms. I search for the DNA of Covid-19 at different time to compare them and detect some mutations.
